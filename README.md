# Weather-Dashboard


## Description

- I was motivated to build this project to have a more convenient way to display the weather around some of my favorite     places and easily view the forecast as well.
- It solves the problem of not knowing if it's a good weekend to travel to hike in the mountains or to drive down to the beach. This lets the user check the weather very quickly 
- From making this I learned the importance of pseudo coding and that it's ok to completely start over. See oldScript.js
- I learned that students can be much better tutors than the professionals who have years of experience.
- I learned that even though jQuery is outdated it can still make code more elegant
- I learned about integrating with APIs


## Installation

To use this website just follow this link

https://everittgill.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/

## Usage

Upon following the link you will see a page that looks like this. Enter whatever city you want and click the button to see the current weather and forecast. 
- In this image you will already see a past search in the form of a button as well as a city typed into the search bar. These will not appear initially and you will need to first search for a city. They are in this image as an example.
