# Weather-Dashboard


## Description

- I was motivated to build this project to have a more convenient way to display the weather around some of my favorite     places and easily view the forecast as well.
- It solves the problem of not knowing if it's a good weekend to travel to hike in the mountains or to drive down to the beach. This lets the user check the weather very quickly 
- From making this I learned the importance of pseudo coding and that it's ok to completely start over. See oldScript.js
- I learned that students can be much better tutors than the professionals who have years of experience.
- I learned that even though jQuery is outdated it can still make code more elegant
- I learned about integrating with APIs

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
